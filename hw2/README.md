1. Name of the business/org: The Parklane Fine Art Gallery

2. What the business does: A local art collective, a gallery run by artists. The Gallery hosts multiple featured artists each month plus juried shows for local, national and international artists.

3. Who is the target demographic?
    a) people looking to buy art
    b) people looking to shop (usually affluent)
    c) artists who want to show

4. How is the website going to help the business make money/be successful?
The website will increase public awareness of the gallery and the collective, thus increasing traffic in the physical gallery. It will also connect to socials of all the members of the collective since not everyone can show in the physical gallery at once.
